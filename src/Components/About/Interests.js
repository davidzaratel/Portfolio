            <p>The areas that I want to pursue are iOS Development and Web Development since they give me the freedom to deliver an immense range
                of solutions to users, with the only limitation being our creativity. Furthermore, I've been able to be immersed in iOS Development
                with two previous internships in which I learned how to collaborate efficiently inside a team and implement technical solutions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to these experiences, my strongest field would be iOS Development programming with Swift and using SwiftUI or UIKit. 
                This would be the main field I would like to focus on in the future. 
                I enjoy this field the most due to having the possibility to reach devices that we use on a daily basis and that spend most of the day with us. Our cell phones 
                are now a tool that we use not only to communicate but also to be entertained, solve daily base problems, create our own content and so much more.            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, I have an affinity with Web Development as well, especially in front-end with ReactJS and back-end with Flask. I'm curious to keep building projects to gain new abilities and dive into them.  
                Furthermore, I'm always open to learn about new programming languages and technologies because it allows me to discover new ways of thinking and it challenges me to keep growing as a Software
                Engineer. That's why I wouldn't restrict myself to a certain technology or programming language because there's always you can learn from a different field or approach to doing things.
